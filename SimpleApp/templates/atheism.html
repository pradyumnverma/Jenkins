    <h1>What is Atheism?</h1>
    <p>
        Atheism is the absence of belief in the existence of deities. It is not a belief system or a religion, but rather a stance on the question of belief in gods. Atheists do not believe in a god or gods, and they often rely on reason, evidence, and science to understand the world. Many atheists also argue that religion is a human construct that arose from various social, psychological, and historical factors.

    <p>
        Atheism can vary from person to person; some atheists actively reject the idea of gods, while others simply do not hold any belief in them. It is important to note that atheism does not inherently lead to any particular moral system, as it is distinct from philosophy and ethics.
